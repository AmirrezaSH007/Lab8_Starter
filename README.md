Graceful degradation means building a website or app that still works when some advanced features aren’t supported. Service workers help with this by making sure the app can work offline or in bad network conditions. Even if someone loses internet connection, service workers can serve cached content so the user still sees something useful. This way, the app doesn't completely break — it just degrades gracefully and still provides a decent experience.
